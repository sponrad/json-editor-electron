# JSON Schema Form Tool for Desktop

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

## Dev setup / Run local

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build for current platform

Using electron-builder for now

I tried electron forge and it gave more errors so...

```
npm run build
npm run package
```
